## graceful degradation and service workers:
Graceful degradation is a design philosophy where a web application provides a baseline level of user experience that works on all browsers and devices, and then adds enhanced functionality for more capable browsers. Service workers contribute to graceful degradation by allowing web applications to provide offline access and faster loading times through caching, even on unreliable networks. While the core functionality might still work without a service worker (e.g., fetching data directly when online), the presence of a service worker enhances the user experience by making the application more resilient to network issues, thus providing a gracefully degraded experience when the network is poor or absent.
